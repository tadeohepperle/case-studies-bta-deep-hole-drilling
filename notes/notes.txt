Fig 3. use the image from the statistics papger to explain what chatter and spiraling is

3.1 "Chatter vibrations are also easily
recognizable by an audible howling."

Following on to chatter, the process may stabilize itself again or spiralling may appear.

In all 21 experiments the signals of the drilling torque and feed force yieldedthe best results

Chatter is easily recognized in the online measurements by a
fast increase of the dynamic part of the torque, force and acceleration signals.
This change of the dynamics of the process takes place within only a few
rotations of the drilling tool.  ==> so how many seconds??

It is possible to characterize dierent types of
chatter in the frequency domain. => "high- and low-frequency chatter."

Acoustic not good enough because noise of factory bad for data


"Torque and force measured by strain gauges"


The most expressive data are the signals of the drilling
torque.

autocorrelation function ACF in normal phase vs chatter, up to 1000 t = 0.05 sec
